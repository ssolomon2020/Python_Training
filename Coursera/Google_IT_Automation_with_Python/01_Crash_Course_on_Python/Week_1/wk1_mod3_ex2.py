# Here's how printing "Hello, World" 10 times looks in Bash and Powershell:

# BASH:
# for i in {1..10}; do
#         echo Hello, World!
# done

# POWERSHELL:
# for ($i=1; $i -le 10; $i++) {
#         Write-Host "Hello, World!"
# }

# Now try out the Python example yourself:

# for i in range(10):
#   print("Hello, World!")

for i in range(50000):
  print("MSG", str(i) + ": Good morning Star Shine... the Earth says HELLO!")
print("Done! Star Shine has been thoroughly annoyed 50,000 times.")
print("You feel", input("How do you feel? ") + ". I can understand...")

print("Perhaps this might make a great case for a progress bar.")
