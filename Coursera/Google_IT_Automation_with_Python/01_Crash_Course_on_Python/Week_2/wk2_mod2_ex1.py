# Do you think you can flesh out your own function? I think you can! Letâ€™s give it a go. 

# Flesh out the body of the print_seconds function so that it prints the total amount of seconds given the hours, minutes, and seconds function parameters.
# Remember that there are 3600 seconds in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute.

# def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
#     print(___)

# print_seconds(1,2,3)

def print_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):
    print(hours * 3600)
    print(minutes * 60)
    print(seconds)

print_seconds(1,2,3)
